<p>When  \(\gamma\) is very very close to 1, each new vertex is practically a duplicate of the vertex that it is copying. So there is a strong correlation between the out-edges of the graph. This would lead to some community structure. However, this doesn't happens for Price's model, since the links are all taken uniformly at random from across the entire network. This out-edge correlation holds for all values of \(\gamma\text{,}\) but is more pronounced for larger \(\gamma\text{.}\)</p>
