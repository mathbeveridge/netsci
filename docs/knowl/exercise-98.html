<p>We apply your results from problem 5 to a real data set. It has been argued (but not proved definitively) that the distribution of wealth in the United States (and other countries) follows a power law tail. (For example, see <a class="external" href="http://phys.org/news95074548.html" target="_blank">this article</a>.) Even if this wealth distribution tail is not a pure power law, then  it is still very similar to a power law. For simplicity, in this problem, we will assume that all of the US wealth adheres to a power law.</p>
<p>Download <a class="external" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gm1-m7qlWafLImqJJ06wkkOWp5krLcBV/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this data set</a>, which lists the net worth of the 400 wealthiest Americans in 2002 in millions of dollars.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Create a log-log plot of the CCDF of this data set to confirm that it looks like a power law.</p></li>
<li><p>Estimate the value of \(\alpha\) for this data set. Use the maximum likelihood estimamtor for a continuous PDF.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the value \(x_{1/2}\) for American wealth in 2002? In other words, if your net worth was at least \(x_{1/2}\text{,}\) then you were in the top half of the population in terms of wealth.</p></li>
<li><p>Now find \(w(1/2)\text{.}\) This is the fraction of the wealth in the hands of the wealthiest half of the population.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, find the value \(r^*\) so that \(w(r^*)=1/2\) and its corresponding \(x_{r^*}\text{.}\) The interpretation: the wealthiest \(r^*\) fraction of the population owns half of the total wealth. In order to be among these super-elite people, your net worth must be at least \(x_{r^*}\text{.}\)</p></li>
