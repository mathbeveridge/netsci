<p>Lusseau and Newman performed a social network analysis on a dolphin population in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand. They used Betweenness Clustering (successively removing edges with highest betweenness) to find two communities of dolphins. These are the black and non-black nodes shown in the figure to the right. The non-black community is further subdivided into 3 sub-communities, according to shade of grey. Females are represented by circles, males by triangles, and unknown gender by squares. <div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="image-box" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"><img src="images/dolphin-network.png" class="contained"></div></p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Following the same workflow as for the Zachary Karate Club, investigate this dolphin social network, which is found in the <code xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">dolphin.gml</code> file linked on the moodle site.</p></li>
<li><p>What value of modularity do you need to use to get 2 communities? 4 communities? How do your communities (found by the Louvain method) compare the the communities found by Lusseau and Newman?</p></li>
<li><p>In the Preview view, make the most compelling graphic you can for the dolphin network. Nodes should be colored according to the four communities you found. The rest is up to you.</p></li>
