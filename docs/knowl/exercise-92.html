</h6>
<p>The Theater and Dance Department is staging a production. This is a complex and time intensive process, requiring the coordination of many simultaneous creative efforts. The cast and crew were given an organizational workflow of who they should approach when they have questions, depending upon their role in the production.</p>
<p>The csv file <a class="external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B3svDEoCnsaLiUTxiBnORu3cqVK70Be5N_OkS-9Rh7E/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">TheaterProductionEdges.csv</a> represents this structure as a weighted directed graph. The weight of arc \((u,v)\) is the number of people in role \(u\text{.}\)  Use Gephi to investigate this complex system. You must:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Create a graph layout using the features of Gephi to make an informative data visualization that helps you to communicate your insights. You can include multiple visualizations, if you like.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the centrality measures that we have discussed to determine the ways in which various roles are important. These are: degree centralities, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, PageRank centrality.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the first, second, and third most important roles in the network. Do some web searching so that you understand the responsibilities of those roles. With that background information, do your results make sense? Comment on the efficacy of the various centrality measures in understanding this network.</p></li>
