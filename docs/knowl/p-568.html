<p>Let the simulation run until the network becomes connected. Do this for \(n= 20, 40, 80, 160, 320\text{.}\) For \(n &gt; 160\text{,}\) you should uncheck the green "layout?" checkbox. This will speed up the process tremendously. You can also use the "model speed" slider to control to increase or decrease the evolution rate.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>What does the graph look like just before becoming totally connected? Consistently, what seems to be the "bottleneck" that prevents the graph from being connected?</p></li>
<li><p>Describe the giant component just before the whole graph becomes connected. It is a dense graph or a sparse graph? What other terms would you use?</p></li>
<li>
<p>What is the average degree of the graph at the moment it becomes connected for each of the graph sizes n listed below.  (Run the simulation multiple times for each graph size and report the average)</p>

\begin{array}{r|c|c|c|c|c|c}
\mbox{network size} &amp; 50 &amp; 100 &amp; 200 &amp; 400 &amp; 500  \\

<li><p>Using the data from the previous question, hypothesize what the relationship is between the size of the graph and the average degree at the moment that the graph becomes connected. For the random graph \(G(n,p)\text{,}\) we know that \(E[\deg(v)]=n p\text{.}\) So what value of \(p\) corresponds to the appearance of the giant component?</p></li>
