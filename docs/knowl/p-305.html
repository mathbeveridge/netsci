<p>Note that there are many possible answers: these are just example responses.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Degree Centrality:   Such a person has lots of direct connections. Therefore she have direct access to the resources/information  of their neighbors. Such a person might be influential since many others will listen to her point of view.</p></li>
<li><p>Betweenness Centrality:  Such a person lies on the shortest path between many pairs of people. Therefore, information traveling between those people will often pass through her. Therefore, she can control the flow of information. Or perhaps she is leveraging her location by acting as a broker: it is to her advantage that these pairs of people don't have direct access to one another. She can act as a "middle man," and benefit from this role.</p></li>
<li><p>Closeness Centrality:  Such a person lies close to many people in the network. Therefore she will receive information quickly. This could allow her to react in a timely manner, regardless of the source/location of the new information. Being well-informed is another type of power.</p></li>
