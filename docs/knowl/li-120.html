<p>Let \(G\) be a  digraph. (\(\Rightarrow\)) Suppose that its adjacency matrix is reducible, so that</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P^{\top} A P = \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
A_{11} &amp; A_{12} \\
0 &amp; A_{22}
\end{array}
\right].
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Then there is is no path from any vertex in the second set to any vertex in the first set. So \(G\) is not strongly connected.</p>
<p>(\(\Leftarrow\)) Next, suppose that \(G\) is not strongly connected, Let \(S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_k\) be its strongly connected components. We claim that  that there must be at least one SCC \(S_{i}\) that has no arcs leading to any other \(S_j\text{.}\) Otherwise, there would be a directed cycle that goes through multiple SCC's, so they would be part of a single SCC. Without loss of generality, there is no directed path from any vertex in \(S_k\) to any vertex in \(S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_k\text{.}\)  List the vertices in \(S_1 \cup  \ldots \cup S_{k-1}\) in \(A_{11}\) and list the vertices \(S_k \cup \) in \(A_{22}\text{.}\) The adjacency matrix has is irreducible.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="algcentrality.html#li-120">in-context</a></span>
