<p>So why do most naturally occurring power laws have \(2 &lt; \alpha &lt; 3\text{?}\) We'll consider the degree sequence for a network. In this range of \(\alpha\text{,}\) the average degree is finite. This makes sense for our graph. Next, we observe that  the second moment  is infinite (and so are the higher moments). This means that the variance of the degrees goes to infinity. Therefore, we expect to find hub nodes with very, very high degree. If \(\alpha &gt; 3\text{,}\) then the second moment would converge, which means that the degrees would be well-concentrated around the expected value. We've already seen how important the hub nodes are in the network. So if hub nodes only occur when \(\alpha &lt; 3\text{,}\) it makes sense that our observed power laws should fall into the range of  \(2 &lt; \alpha &lt; 3\text{.}\)</p>
