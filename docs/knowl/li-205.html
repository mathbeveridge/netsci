<p>The variance is</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\var[X] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">This number tells me about the "spread" of the distribution around its average value. A small variance means that the PMF is concentrated around the average value, so most of my experiments will return a value that is close to the average one. A large variance means that the values are more spread out.</p>
<p>Taking the square root gives you the standard deviation \(\sigma = \sqrt{\var[X]}\text{.}\) We can compare this value directly to the expected value, since they have the same units. This helps to get a sense of whether the variance is "big" or "small." Comparing standard deviation to the expected value helps to give us some sense of scale.</p>
<p>For example, in a graph with small variance, most of the vertices have similar degrees. In a graph with high variance, we will have a much more diverse collection of vertex degrees. In particular, there will be some vertices with much smaller degrees than typical, or some vertices with much larger degree than typical, or both.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="exercises-9.html#li-205">in-context</a></span>
