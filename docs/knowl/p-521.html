<p>An acyclic tournament is an orientation of a complete graph that contains no directed cycles.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Prove that every triangle is <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">transitive</em>, meaning that if \((u,v)\) and \((v,w)\) are both arcs, then \((u,w)\) is also an arc.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that an <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">acyclic</em> tournament has a unique source vertex \(s\) (with \(\kin_s=0\)) and a unique sink vertex \(t\) (with \(\kout_t = 0\)).</p></li>
<li><p>Use part (b) and induction on \(N\) to prove that there is a unique acyclic tournament structure on \(N\) vertices (up to isomorphism). Or equivalently, show that we can label the vertices of a transitive tournament on \(N\) vertices using labels \([N] = \{ 1,2, \ldots, N \}\) such that if \(i &gt;j\) then \((i,j)\) is an arc in the tournament.</p></li>
<li><p>A transitive tournament is a tournament in which every triangle is transitive. Prove that a transitive tournament is acyclic. (Hint: there is a nice poof by induction on \(k\) for the statement "\(D\) has no \(k\) cycles for \(3 \leq k \leq N\text{.}\)" But there are other proofs, too.)</p></li>
