<p>Let \(G=(V,E)\) be an undirected graph. Let \(D\) be an orientation of this graph (so \(D\) is a directed graph).</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Prove that if \(D\) is strongly connected, then every pair of vertices in \(G\) is connected by two edge-disjoint paths.</p></li>
<li>
<p>The converse is also true: if every pair of vertices in \(G\) is connected by two edge-disjoint paths, then there is a strongly connected orientation \(D\) of the graph. Here is the sketch of an algorithm  that orients the edges of \(G\) to obtain a strongly connected digraph.</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>Start with any two vertices \(u,v\) and orient some edges so that they are strongly connected to one another.  Let \(S = \{ u , v\}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Pick a vertex \(w \notin S\text{.}\) If \(w\) and \(v\) are not strongly connected, then orient some edges to make this happen. Add \(w\) to \(S\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the previous step until \(S = V\text{,}\) which means that every vertex is strongly connected to \(v\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>If there any any non-oriented edges, give them an orientation.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="continuation">Fill in the details of the algorithm by explaining how to "orient some edges" in steps i, ii and iv. Explain <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">how to choose</em> the edges to orient, and <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">how to pick</em> the orientation of each edge.   Finally, justify why your algorithm results in a strongly connected digraph. Drawing pictures while you are thinking  (and explaining) will really help!</p>
