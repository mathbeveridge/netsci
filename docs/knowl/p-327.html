<li><p>Click on the "Overview" button at the top of the window. We will now add our first filter: we only want to show nodes of high degree.</p></li>
<li><p>In the right-hand window, click on the "Filter" tab (which is next to the "Statistics" tab. Explore down to  "Attributes/Range/Degree." Then drag "Degree" to the lower half of this tab (named "Queries"). Click on "Filter."</p></li>
<li><p>Adjust the Query slider. Among the highest degree nodes, what is the maximum number that form a complete graph (also known as a "clique")? What is the smallest degree (in the overall graph) of vertices in this clique?</p></li>
<li><p>Make a new Query using other centrality measures where you saw a big gap in the ranking value. How connected are the high ranking nodes for this measure? What other interesting observations can you make about these nodes? Is there a clear internal structure? Or perhaps a lack of one?</p></li>
