<li><p>Now click on the "Data Laboratory" button at the top of the window. You can sort the table by a column by  clicking on the header. Clicking again reverses the ordering. Once again, look at which centrality measures are correlated, and which are not. Again, record your observations. Go back and pick a visualization that captures something interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>Sort the nodes by degree. Are there any natural gap(s) that separate large degree nodes from the others? Now sort them by the other centrality measures. Do you see any large gaps in these ranking values that separate the "important" nodes from the rest?</p></li>
<li><p>Find one (or more) lower degree node that ranks highly in one (or more)  of the other betweenness measures. If so, change your visualization to highlight these nodes. Can you explain why that node ranks highly?</p></li>
