<p>(\(\Leftarrow\)) Next, suppose that \(G\) is not strongly connected, Let \(S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_k\) be its strongly connected components. We claim that  that there must be at least one SCC \(S_{i}\) that has no arcs leading to any other \(S_j\text{.}\) Otherwise, there would be a directed cycle that goes through multiple SCC's, so they would be part of a single SCC. Without loss of generality, there is no directed path from any vertex in \(S_k\) to any vertex in \(S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_k\text{.}\)  List the vertices in \(S_1 \cup  \ldots \cup S_{k-1}\) in \(A_{11}\) and list the vertices \(S_k \cup \) in \(A_{22}\text{.}\) The adjacency matrix has is irreducible.</p>
