Today, we will talk about (a variation of) the Small World Model of Strogatz and Watts. Their goal was to create a network model that has high clustering (lots of triangles) and small diameter (short connecting paths).

			<statement>
				<p>
You will calculate the clustering coefficient
<me>
C = \frac{3 \times (\mbox{# of triangles})}{\mbox{# of connected triples}}
</me>
where a "connected triple" are three vertices <m>u,v,w</m> such that <m>(u,v)</m> and <m>(v,w)</m> are edges. Intuitively, the clustering coefficient measures the  fraction of times that "pairs of my friends are also friends."

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Show that there are
<me>
n {c/2 \choose 2}
</me>
triangles in a Ring World.
A nice way to argue this is to
recognize that all triangles look like one "long edge" going distance <m>\leq c/2</m> and two "shorter edges." Orient the long edge  clockwise the two shorter edges  counter clockwise. Then associate this directed cycle with the vertex at the start of the long clockwise arc.


<!--solution>
	<p>We must pick a vertex and then pick two of its right-neighbors.</p>
</solution-->
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Show that there are
<me>
n {c \choose 2}
</me>
connected triples. These are paths of length 2 (which can be associated with their central vertex).


<!--solution>
	<p>We must pick the central vertex, then pick two of its neighbors.</p>
</solution-->

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Show that the clustering coefficient  is
<me>
C =  \frac{3(c-2)}{4(c-1)}.
</me>
Furthermore, for <m>c \geq 3</m>, we have <m>\frac{3}{8} \leq C  \leq  \frac{3}{4}</m>. This is independent of the network size <m>n</m>, so we have high clustering.

<!--solution>
	<p>The clustering coefficient is
<me>
\frac{3 n {c/2 \choose 2}}{n {c \choose 2}} 
= \frac{ 3 (c/2) (c/2-1)}{c(c-1)}
= \frac{3(c-2)}{4(c-1)}.

 Consider vertices <m>v_0</m> and <m>v_{m}</m> where <m>0 \leq m \leq n/2</m>. What is the graph distance between these nodes?

		The graph distance is

 What is the length of the "longest shortest path" starting at <m>v_0</m>?

		The longest shortest path goes to vertex <m>v_{n/2</m>} with distance
<me>
	d(v_0, v_{n/2}) = \left\lceil \frac{n/2}{c/2} \right\rceil = \left\lceil \frac{n}{c} \right\rceil.

			<title>Clustering Coefficient of a Small World</title>
			<idx><h>Clustering Coefficient of a Small World</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
We turn the Ring World into a Small World by adding  some random edges to the graph. We call these edges "shortcuts" because they traverse across the middle of the ring.

			</p><p>
For each existing edge in the Ring World, we add a random edge with constant probability <m>p</m>. So we add a total of
<me>
p\frac{cn}{2} = \frac{1}{2} cpn
</me>
random edges to the graph.
			<ol>

				<li>
					<p>
  Define
<me>
q = \frac{\frac{cpn}{2}}{{n \choose 2}} \approx \frac{cp}{n}.
</me>
For any potential shortcut edge <m>e</m>, explain why
<me>
\P[ \mbox{edge } e \mbox{ is added to the graph}] \leq q.
</me>

					</p>
<p>
	<!--solution>
		<p>
			We add a total of <m>\frac{cpn}{2}</m> edges out of a possible <m>{n \choose 2}</m> edges.
			This fraction is an upper bound because we could choose the same edge twice.
		</p>

	</solution-->
</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 For a fixed vertex <m>v_i</m>, explain why
<me>
\E[ \mbox{# shortcut edges incident with } v_i] = cp.
</me>




					</p>
					<p>
						<!--solution>
							<p>
								We add a total of <m>\frac{cpn}{2}</m> edges. Each time we add an edge, the probability 
								that <m>v_i</m> is one of the endpoints is <m>2/n</m>.
							</p>
						</solution-->
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Next, we show that we have only added a constant number of new triangles. Show that
<me>
\E[\mbox{# triangles using one shortcut edge} ] \leq
n{ c \choose 2} q
\approx pc^3/2.
</me>
So we are adding a constant number of triangles.
For large <m>n</m>, these new triangles are negligible compared to the <m>n { c/2 \choose 2}</m> 
triangles already present in the ring.

					</p>
					<p>
						<!--solution>
							<p>
								Such a triangle has two ring edges. We have <m>n</m> choices for the central vertex. We then have <m>{c \choose 2</m> ways to choose its two neighbors.
									Finally, we add the shortcut edge with probabilty <m>q</m>.
							</p>
						</solution-->
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Triangles using 2 or 3 shortcut edges are also unlikely. Explain why
<me>
\E[\mbox{# triangles using two shortcut edges} ]=
n \frac{c}{2} (n-2) q^2   \approx \frac{c^3p^2}{2}.
</me>
and
<me>
\E[\mbox{# triangles using three shortcut edges} ] =
{n \choose 3} q^3   \approx \frac{c^3p^3}{6}.
</me>
So we only add a constant number of triangles of any kind.

					</p>
					<p>
						<!--solution>
							<p>
								A triangle with two shortcut edges contains one ring edge (which we orient clockwise so that we
								only count it once) and a third vertex. We have <m>n</m> choices for the first endpoint of the ring edge.
								We have <m>c/2</m> choices for the other endpoint. Then we have <m>n-2</m> choices for the third vertex. 
								We multiply by <m>q^2</m> which is the probability that both shortcut edges are present.
							</p>
							<p>
								As for a triangle with three shortcut edges, we cn choose the vertices in <m>{n \choose 3}</m>. 
								We multiply by <m>q^3</m> which is the probability that all three shortcut edges are present. 
							</p>
						</solution-->
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Turning to connected triples, show that
<me>
\E[ \mbox{# connected triples using one shortcut edge} ]
= \frac{cpn}{2} (c + c) = c^2 p n.
</me>
and that
<me>
\E[ \mbox{# connected triples using two shortcut edges} ]
=
n {n-1 \choose 2} q^2
\approx \frac{c^2 p^2}{2} n.
</me>




					</p>
					<p>
						<!--solution>
							<p>
								For each shortcut edge, there are <m>c</m> ring edges incident with each enpoint.
								So the expected number of such triples is <m>\frac{cpn}{2} (c + c) = c^2 p n</m>
							</p>
							<p>
								For each pair of shortcut edges incident with the same vertex, we must choose the other 
								endpoints. So there are <m>n</m> ways to choose the common vertex, and <m>{n-1 \choose 2}</m> ways
								to choose the other endpoints. We multiply by <m>q^2</m> since this is the probability that both
								shortcut edges are present.
					
							</p>
						</solution-->
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 We are now ready to approximate the clustering coefficient.
By parts (c) and (d), we can ignore the new triangles (there are only a constant number of them).
But we need the new connected triples from part (e).

The clustering coefficient is
<me>
C \approx \frac
{
3 n {c/2 \choose 2}
}
{
n {c \choose 2} + c^2pn + \frac{1}{2} c^2p^2 n
}
=
\frac
{
3{c/2 \choose 2}
}
{
{c \choose 2} + c^2p + \frac{1}{2} c^2p^2.
}
</me>
This is a constant (independent of <m>n</m>), so we have a nonzero clustering coefficient for every small world network.

			</p><p>

Use the approximation <m>{a \choose 2} = a^2/2</m> and set <m>p=1</m> to obtain the rough lower bound
<me>
C \gtrapprox \frac{3}{16}.
</me>
