	<title>The Small World Model</title>
	<introduction>
		<p>


Today, we will talk about (a variation of) the Small World Model of Strogatz and Watts. Their goal was to create a network model that has high clustering (lots of triangles) and small diameter (short connecting paths).

			<title>Clustering Coefficient for a Ring World</title>
			<idx><h>Clustering Coefficient for a Ring World</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
You will calculate the clustering coefficient
<me>
C = \frac{3 \times (\mbox{\# of triangles})}{\mbox{\# of connected triples}}
</me>
where a "connected triple" are three vertices <m>u,v,w</m> such that <m>(u,v)</m> and <m>(v,w)</m> are edges. Intuitively, the clustering coefficient measures the  fraction of times that "pairs of my friends are also friends."

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Show that there are
<me>
n {c/2 \choose 2}
</me>
triangles in a Ring World.
A nice way to argue this is to
recognize that all triangles look like one "long edge" going distance <m>\leq c/2</m> and two "shorter edges." Orient the long edge  clockwise the two shorter edges  counter clockwise. Then associate this directed cycle with the vertex at the start of the long clockwise arc.



					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Show that there are
<me>
n {c \choose 2}
</me>
connected triples. These are paths of length 2 (which can be associated with their central vertex).


					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Show that the clustering coefficient  is
<me>
C =  \frac{3(c-2)}{4(c-1)}.
</me>
Furthermore, for <m>c \geq 3</m>, we have <m>\frac{3}{8} \leq C  \leq  \frac{3}{4}</m>. This is independent of the network size <m>n</m>, so we have high clustering.

				<li>

 Consider vertices <m>v_0</m> and <m>v_{m}</m> where <m>0 \leq m \leq n/2</m>. What is the graph distance between these nodes?

				<li>

 What is the length of the "longest shortest path" starting at <m>v_0</m>?


					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Show that the average distance from <m>v_0</m> to other vertices is less than or equal to
<me>
\frac{n}{2c} + 1.
</me>
Hint: you can use the upper bound <m>\lceil x \rceil \leq x + 1</m> for any <m>x \in \R</m>.

			<title>Clustering Coefficient of a Small World</title>
			<idx><h>Clustering Coefficient of a Small World</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
We turn the Ring World into a Small World by adding  some random edges to the graph. We call these edges "shortcuts" because they traverse across the middle of the ring.

			</p><p>
For each existing edge in the Ring World, we add a random edge with constant probability <m>p</m>. So we add a total of
<me>
p\frac{cn}{2} = \frac{1}{2} cpn
</me>
random edges to the graph.
			<ol>

				<li>
					<p>
  Define
<me>
q = \frac{\frac{cpn}{2}}{{n \choose 2}} \approx \frac{cp}{n}.
</me>
For any potential shortcut edge <m>e</m>, explain why
<me>
\P[ \mbox{edge } e \mbox{ is added to the graph}] \leq q.
</me>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 For a fixed vertex <m>v_i</m>, explain why
<me>
\E[ \mbox{\# shortcut edges incident with } v_i] = cp.
</me>




					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Next, we show that we have only added a constant number of new triangles. Show that
<me>
\E[\mbox{\# triangles using one shortcut edge} ] \leq
n{ c \choose 2} q
\approx pc^3/2.
</me>
So we are adding a constant number of triangles.
For large <m>n</m>, these new triangles are negligible compared to the <m>n { c/2 \choose 2}</m> triangles already present in the ring.

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Triangles using 2 or 3 shortcut edges are also unlikely. Explain why
<me>
\E[\mbox{\# triangles using two shortcut edges} ]=
n \frac{c}{2} (n-2) q^2   \approx \frac{c^3p^2}{2}.
</me>
and
<me>
\E[\mbox{\# triangles using three shortcut edges} ] =
{n \choose 3} q^3   \approx \frac{c^3p^3}{6}.
</me>
So we only add a constant number of triangles of any kind.

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Turning to connected triples, show that
<me>
\E[ \mbox{\# connected triples using one shortcut edge} ]
= \frac{cpn}{2} (c + c) = c^2 p n.
</me>
and that
<me>
\E[ \mbox{\# connected triples using two shortcut edges} ]
=
n {n-1 \choose 2} q^2
\approx \frac{c^2 p^2}{2} n.
</me>




					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 We are now ready to approximate the clustering coefficient.
By parts (c) and (d), we can ignore the new triangles (there are only a constant number of them).
But we need the new connected triples from part (e).

The clustering coefficient is
<me>
C \approx \frac
{
n {c/2 \choose 2}
}
{
n {c \choose 2} + c^2pn + \frac{1}{2} c^2p^2 n
}
=
\frac
{
3{c/2 \choose 2}
}
{
{c \choose 2} + c^2p + \frac{1}{2} c^2p^2.
}
</me>
This is a constant (independent of <m>n</m>), so we have a nonzero clustering coefficient for every small world network.

			</p><p>

Use the approximation <m>{a \choose 2} = a^2/2</m> and set <m>p=1</m> to obtain the rough lower bound
<me>
C \gtrapprox \frac{3}{16}.
</me>
