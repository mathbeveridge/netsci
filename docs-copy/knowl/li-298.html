<p>Suppose that \(G\) is an undirected graph, so that its adjacency matrix is symmetric. The undirected graph \(G\) is reducible if and only if there is a permutation matrix \(P\) such that</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P^{\top} A P = \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
A_{11} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; A_{22}
\end{array}
\right].
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Finally, we note that the matrix \(P^{\top} A P\) simply corresponds to reordering the vertices of \(G\text{.}\)</p>
<p>(\(\Rightarrow\)) Suppose that \(G\) is reducible.  There are no paths from the vertices of submatrix \(A_{11}\) to the vertices of submatrix \(A_{22}\text{.}\) So the graph is not connected.</p>
<p>(\(\Leftarrow\)) Suppose that \(G\) is not connected: let's suppose that \(G\) splits into two graphs \(G_1\) and \(G_2\) that have no edges between them. Create the adjacency matrix by listing the vertices in \(G_1\) and then listing the vertices in \(G_2\text{.}\)  Then this adjacency matrix is of the desired form.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="exercises-13.html#li-298">in-context</a></span>
