<li><p>In fact, there is only one way to make a transitive tournament on \(n\) unlabelled vertices. In particular, there will always be a <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">source</em> vertex with all arcs pointing outwards, and a <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">sink</em> vertex with all arcs pointing inwards. <div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="images/fig-img-graphs1.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div></p></li>
<li>
<p>\((\Rightarrow)\) Suppose that \(T\) is a transitive tournament that contains a cycle. Pick a cycle \(C\) of shortest length on vertices \(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k\text{.}\) Note that \(k &gt;3\) since the definition of a transitive tournament forbids a directed 3-cycle. Look at the arc between \(v_1\) and \(v_3\text{.}\) Since \(v_1 v_2\) and \(v_2 v_3\) are arcs, this forces \(v_1 v_3\) to be an arc. But then \(v_1, v_3, \ldots v_k\) is a directed cycle whose length is shorter than \(C\text{,}\) a contradiction. Therefore \(T\) cannot contain any directed cycles.</p>
<p>\((\Leftarrow)\) Suppose that \(T\) has no directed cycles. Suppose that \((u,v)\) and \((v,w)\) are arcs. We cannot have a directed 3-cycle, so \(u\) and \(w\) must be connected by the arc \((u,w)\text{.}\) Therefore, \(T\) is transitive.</p>
