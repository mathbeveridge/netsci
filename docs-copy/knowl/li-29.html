<p>Betweenness Centrality:  Such a person lies on the shortest path between many pairs of people. Therefore, information traveling between those people will often pass through her. Therefore, she can control the flow of information. Or perhaps she is leveraging her location by acting as a broker: it is to her advantage that these pairs of people don't have direct access to one another.
