<li><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">High in-degree centrality means that lots of information gets to you. High out-degree means that a lot of people are listening to you.</p></li>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">You would need two different closeness centralities. Large \(c_i^{C^{\mathrm{in}}}\) would mean that spreading information gets to you quickly. Large \(c_i^{C^{\mathrm{out}}}\) would mean that information that you share would spread quickly to the whole network.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">You would still only have one betweenness centrality measure on a directed graph. The definition already includes paths from \(s\) to \(t\) and from \(t\) to \(s\text{.}\) This "double counting" on an undirected graph becomes "single counting" when the paths are directed.</p>
