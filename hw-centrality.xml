				<li>
					<p>
 For each of our basic centrality measures (degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality), prove that if you add the edge <m>(u,v)</m> to <m>G</m> then the centrality of vertex <m>u</m> does not <em>decrease</em>. (Mathematically, we say that the centrality of <m>u</m> is <em>weakly increasing</em> for edge additions at <m>u</m>.)

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Which of these centrality measures are weakly increasing at <em>every</em> vertex <m>w</m> when you add a particular edge <m>(u,v)</m>? For those that are weakly increasing, give a proof. For those that are not weakly increasing, give an example where adding the edge <m>(u,v)</m> decreases the centrality at some other vertex <m>w</m>.

				<p>
Let <m>G</m> be an undirected tree. Removing the edge <m>(u,v)</m>  splits the graph into two disjoint trees <m>G_1</m> and <m>G_2</m> where <m>u \in V(G_1)</m> and <m>v \in V(G_2)</m>.
Suppose that   <m>G_1</m> has <m>N_1</m> vertices and <m>G_2</m> has <m>N_2</m> vertices.
Prove that the (un-normalized) closeness centralities of <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> satisfy
<me>
\frac{1}{c_u^C} + N_1 = \frac{1}{c_v^C} + N_2.

Let <m>G</m> be an undirected tree on <m>N</m> vertices. Let <m>v</m> be a vertex with degree <m>k_v = k</m>. Removing the vertex <m>v</m> splits the tree into <m>k \geq 2</m> disjoint trees <m>G_1,G_2, \ldots, G_k</m>.
Suppose that tree <m>G_i</m> contains <m>N_i</m> vertices for <m>1 \leq i \leq k</m>. Show that

			<title>Counting Lazy Walks</title>
			<idx><h>Counting Lazy Walks</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
In a <em>lazy walk</em> on a directed graph, at each step, we can either stay at the current vertex or move to an adjacent vertex. So a lazy walk of length <m>k</m> is a sequence of vertices <m>v_0, v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k</m> where for <m>1 \leq i \leq k</m>, we either have <m>v_i = v_{i-1}</m> or <m>(v_{i-1}, v_i)</m> is an arc of <m>G</m>.

Let <m>A</m> be the adjacency matrix of a directed graph <m>G</m>, so that <m>a_{ij}</m> is 1 if <m>(i,j)</m> is an arc and  is 0 otherwise. Using induction on <m>k \geq 0</m>, prove that  the <m>ij</m>th entry of <m>(I+A)^k</m> counts the number of lazy walks of length <m>k</m> from vertex <m>i</m> to vertex <m>j</m>.

In this problem, you will prove part of the Perron-Frobenius Theorem. Let <m>\bx, \by \in \R^n</m>. Recall that the <em>dot product</em> is defined as <m>\bx \cdot \by = \bx^{\top} \by</m>, and that <m>\bx</m> and <m>\by</m> are orthogonal when <m>\bx \cdot \by = 0</m>.

   Let <m>A</m> be an <m>n \times n</m> matrix. Prove that

 Let <m>A</m> be a symmetric matrix, so that <m>A = A^{\top}</m>. Let <m>\lambda</m> and <m>\mu</m> be distinct nonzero eigenvalues with corresponding (right) eigenvectors <m>\bu</m> and <m>\bv</m>, so that <m>A \bu = \lambda \bu</m> and <m>A \bv = \mu \bv</m>.
Prove that <m>(A \bu) \cdot \bv =0</m>.

			<statement>
				<p>
Let <m>A</m> be the adjacency matrix for a connected, undirected and aperiodic graph.
Recall that the Frobenius-Perron Theorem guarantees that the symmetric matrix <m>A</m>    has real eigenvalues <m>\kappa_1 \geq \kappa_2 \geq \cdots \geq \kappa_n</m> with corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors <m>\bu_1, \bu_2, \ldots , \bu_n</m>. Furthermore
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 The eigenvalue <m>\kappa_1</m> has multiplicity one, and <m>\kappa_1 &gt; | \kappa_i |</m> for <m>2 \leq i \leq n</m>.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 The corresponding eigenvector <m>\bu_1</m> has non-negative entries.
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
In this problem, you will show that when <m>n \geq 3</m>, we have  <m>\kappa_1 \geq 1</m>.

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
 Let <m>\bx = A \bone</m>. Explain explain why  <m>\bx \geq \bone</m>, (meaning <m>x_i \geq 1</m> for all <m>i</m>), and explain why  there is at least one <m>j</m> such that <m>x_j &gt; 1</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 The orthonormal eigenvectors <m>\bu_1, \bu_2, \ldots , \bu_n</m> form a basis for <m>\R^n</m>. So there exist <m>c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n</m> such that
<me>
\bone = c_1 \bu_1 + c_2 \bu_2 + \cdots + c_n \bu_n.
</me>
Consider
<me>
A \bone = A(c_1 \bu_1 + c_2 \bu_2 + \cdots + c_n \bu_n).
</me>
Explain why <m>\kappa_1 &lt; 1</m> leads to a contradiction to your observations in part (a).

			<statement>
				<p>
Let <m>G</m> be a <em>simple undirected graph</em> with <m>n \times n</m> adjacency matrix <m>A</m>. Since <m>G</m> is undirected, its adjacency matrix is symmetric:  <m>A = A^{\top}</m>. Therefore, the Katz centrality <m>\bx \in \R^n</m> is limiting value of the Katz recursion

\bx_t &amp;= \alpha A \bx_{t-1} + \bone  \mbox{for } t \geq 2

<p>
for some choice of <m>\alpha</m>. Let <m>\kappa_1, \ldots \kappa_n</m> be the eigenvalues of <m>A</m> with corresponding eigenvectors <m>\bu_1, \bu_2, \ldots, \bu_n</m>. By the Frobenius-Perron Theorem, <m>\kappa_1 &gt; | \kappa_i |</m> for <m>2 \leq i \leq n</m>, and  the eigenvectors form a basis for <m>\R^n</m>.
Note that <m>\bu_1</m> is the eigenvector centrality of <m>G</m>.

You will show that as <m>\alpha \rightarrow 1/\kappa_1</m>, the Katz centrality becomes proportional to eigenvector centrality.

\by_{i,t} = \left( 1 + \alpha \kappa_i + \alpha^2 {\kappa_i^2} + \cdots  + \alpha^{t-1} {\kappa_i^{t-1}} \right) \bu_i = \sum_{k=0}^{t-1} (\alpha \kappa_i)^k \bu_i.

 Pick our constant <m>\alpha &gt; 0 </m> such that
<me>
\frac{1}{ \kappa_1} &lt; \alpha &lt;  \frac{1}{|\kappa_i|}

for <m>2 \leq i \leq n</m>. Show that
<me>
\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} |\by_{1,t} | = \infty
</me>
while for <m>2 \leq i \leq n</m>, 
<me>
\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} |\by_{i,t}| \mbox{ is finite}.

You will need to use one (or both) of the following facts about geometric sums and geometric series:
<me>
1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + \cdots + r^t = \sum_{k=0}^{t} r^k =  \frac{r^{t+1} -1}{r-1}
</me>
and
<me>
1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + \cdots = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} r^k =
\left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\frac{1}{1-r} &amp; \mbox{if } |r| &lt; 1, \\
\infty &amp; \mbox{otherwise}.

 We know that the eignvectors <m>\bu_1, \ldots, \bu_n</m> form a basis for <m>\R^n</m> (thanks, Frobenius-Perron!). In particular, we have
<me>
\bone = c_1 \bu_1 + c_2 \bu_2 + \cdots + c_n \bu_n
</me>
for some choice of  <m>c_1, \ldots, c_n \in \R</m>. Let us assume that <m>c_1 \neq 0</m>. Use parts (a) and (b) to show that the limiting value
<me>
\bx_t = \alpha A \bx_{t-1} + \bone
</me>
of the Katz recursion is basically <em>proportional</em> to the eigenvector centrality <m>\bu_1</m>. In other words, show that
<me>
	\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\bx_t}{| \bx_t |} = \frac{\bu_1}{| \bu_1|}.

			<idx><h>Katz centrality as <m>\alpha \rightarrow 0</m></h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
Now let's talk about what happens to the Katz centrality as <m>\alpha \rightarrow 0</m>. You will show that for very small <m>\alpha</m>, the Katz centrality gives a vertex ranking that is equivalent to degree centrality, meaning that the order of the ranking is the same as the degree centrality ranking. This time, we will start with the following equation, which is satisfied by the limiting solution to the Katz recursion:
<me>
\bx =  \alpha A \bx + \bone.
</me>

			<ol>

				<li>
					<p>
 Explain why <m>A \bone &lt; n  \bone</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 If <m>B</m> is an <m>n \times n</m> matrix and suppose that <m>(I-B)</m> is invertible, then we know that
<me>
(I-B)^{-1} = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} B^j =  I + B + B^2 + \cdots +  B^j + \cdots.
</me>
Use this fact to show that
<me>
\bx  = \bone + \alpha A \bone + \alpha^2 A^2 \bone + \cdots +  \alpha^s A^s \bone + \cdots
</me>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Next, let <m>\alpha = 1/m</m> where <m>m &gt; 0</m> is a very large number (to be determined later). Use parts (a) and (b) to show that
<me>
\bx  = \bone + \frac{1}{m} A \bone + \bb
</me>
where <m>\bb</m> is a vector satisfying
<me>
| \bb | &lt;  \frac{n}{m (m-1)} \bone.
</me>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Finally, take <m>m = n^2</m> and look at <m>\bx - \bone</m>. Explain why  ordering of the vertices by the entries in <m>\bx - \bone</m> gives the same ranking as degree centrality (as long as <m>n \geq 2</m>).  A similar argument holds for any <m>m &gt; n^2</m>, so as <m>\alpha \rightarrow 0</m>, the ranking is the same as the degree centrality ranking.
