	<title>Price's Model for a Citation Network</title>
	<introduction>
		<p>


Here is Price's Model for a citation network.
Start with a small set of initial papers (with no citations).
When a new paper is added, it cites  <m>c</m> existing papers (on average). Each paper is chosen as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 with <m>\displaystyle{\P = \frac{a}{a+c}}</m>,   cite a uniformly random paper
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 with <m>\displaystyle{\P = \frac{c}{a+c}}</m>,  cite a  paper with probability proportional to its current citation count.
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
The tail of the degree distribution satisfies the power law
<me>
\P(\deg(v) = k) \sim k^{-2-a/c}.
</me>

Suppose that we have run Price's Model and that the network has <m>n</m> vertices. We now add vertex <m>n+1</m>, as well as <m>c</m> arcs from vertex <m>n+1</m> to the existing network.

Consider the following network growth model. 

		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 with <m>\displaystyle{\P = \frac{a}{a+c}}</m>,   pick a <em>paper</em> uniformly at random. Cite this paper.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 with <m>\displaystyle{\P = \frac{c}{a+c}}</m>,  pick a <em>directed edge</em> uniformly at random. Then cite the paper that the edge points to.
			</p>

		</ul>
Show that when we add vertex <m>n+1</m>, this local process ALSO satisfies
<me>
\P(\mbox{the arc points to vertex } i) = \frac{a+k_i}{n(c+a)}.
</me>


<solution>
<p>
With probability <m>\frac{a}{a+c}</m>, we pick a random vertex. With probability <m>\frac{c}{a+c}</m>, we pick a random arc, and then take its target vertex.
Among the <m>cn</m> arcs, <m>k_i</m> of them end at vertex <m>i</m>.
This gives the same equation
<me>
\frac{a}{a+c} \cdot \frac{1}{n} + \frac{c}{a+c} \cdot \frac{k_i}{cn}

as in the previous question.

			<title>The Vertex Copying Model</title>
			<idx><h>The Vertex Copying Model</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					One critique of Price's Model is that the new paper must know about the degrees of the entire network when we 
choose its citations. So this is a "global" process instead of a "local" process. Consider the following process 
instead.
 Start with a network of <m>n_0 &gt; c</m> papers, each pointing randomly to <m>c</m> others. Pick a constant <m>0 &lt; \gamma &lt; 1</m>.  When paper <m>n+1</m> is added, it makes <m>c</m> citations as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 Pick a random paper <m>v</m> from the existing <m>n</m> vertices.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 For each of the <m>c</m> citations of <m>v</m> (that is, the arcs starting at <m>v</m>),
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 with <m>\displaystyle{\P = \gamma}</m>,   copy that citation
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 with <m>\displaystyle{\P = 1 - \gamma}</m>,  cite a uniform random paper instead.
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

You will now show that this model also generates a power law degree distribution.
			<ol>

				<li>
					<p>
 Show that for each arc starting at vertex <m>n+1</m>, we have
<me>
\P(\mbox{the arc points to vertex } i) = (1- \gamma) \frac{1}{n}  + \gamma \frac{k_i}{cn}.
</me>

<solution>
<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 The probability that we consider copying a citation to paper <m>i</m> is <m>\frac{k_i}{cn}</m>. The probability that we do copy that citation is <m>\gamma</m>. We try this <m>c</m> times.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 The expected number of random citations we make is <m>c(1-\gamma)</m>. A paper has probability <m>\frac{1}{n}</m> of being chosen each time.
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

<em>Note: </em> Assuming that <m>n</m> is large compared to <m>c</m>, the probability that <m>i</m> gets multiple citations is negligible, so below, we will use the approximation
<m>\P</m>(paper <m>i</m> receives a citation) <m>\approx \E(\#</m> citations received by paper <m>i</m>).


</p>
</solution>

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
 Define <m>a = c \left( \frac{1}{\gamma} -1 \right)</m>. Confirm that this equation is equivalent to
<m>\gamma = \frac{c}{c+a}</m>.

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
  Plug <m>\gamma = \frac{c}{c+a}</m> into equation from part (a) and simplify to show that we once again get
<me>
\P(\mbox{the arc points to vertex } i) = \frac{a+k_i}{n(c+a)}.
</me>

<solution>
<p>

</p>
<md>
<mrow>
\P(\mbox{the arc points to vertex } i)
&amp;= (1- \gamma) \frac{1}{n}  + \gamma \frac{k_i}{cn}

 Finally, rewrite the power law
<me>
\P(\deg(v) = k) \sim k^{-2-a/c}
</me>
in terms of <m>\gamma</m> instead of <m>a</m> and <m>c</m>.

<solution>
<p>
The degree distribution is governed by the power law
<me>
p_k \sim k^{-2-a/c} = k^{-2- 1/\gamma +1} = k^{-1 - 1/\gamma}
</me>
where <m>0 &lt; \gamma &lt; 1</m>. Depending on the value of <m>\gamma</m>, our power law exponent <m>\alpha</m> can take on any value <m>\alpha &gt; 2</m>.

This vertex copying model leads to the same equations for the degree distribution of the resulting network. 
However, the actual network structure of the vertex copying model is very different from the netwok structure of 
Price's Model. Explain why. (Hint: start by thinking about what the vertex copying model would look like when 
<m>\gamma</m> is very very close to 1.)

<solution>
<p>
When  <m>\gamma</m> is very very close to 1, each new vertex is practically a duplicate of the vertex that it is copying.
So there is a strong correlation between the out-edges of the graph. This would lead to some community structure. 
However, this doesn't happens for Price's model, since the links are all taken uniformly at random from across the entire network. 
This out-edge correlation holds for all values of <m>\gamma</m>, but is more pronounced for larger <m>\gamma</m>.

			<statement>
				<p>
Here is the Barabasi-Albert Preferential Attachmnent Model for an <b>undirected</b> network. We start with a complete graph on <m>c+1</m> vertices.
				</p>
				<p>
When we add the new vertex <m>n+1</m> to the network of size <m>n</m>,  
we create <m>c</m> undirected edges incident with <m>n+1</m>. The other endpoint <m>i</m> of each edge is chosen
with probability proportional to its current degree <m>k_i</m>. 
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			Explain why the probability that an edge from vertex <m>n+1</m> attaches to vertex <m>i</m> is <me>\frac{k_i}{2cn}.</me>
<solution>
<p>
</p><p>
The total number of edges in the network of order <m>n</m> is <m>2cn</m>. So the probability that we pick vertex <m>i</m>
is <me>\frac{k_i}{2cn}.</me>
</p>
</solution>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Now change this network model to a <b>directed</b> network. Show that 
			<me>k_i= k_i^{\mathrm{in}} + k_i^{\mathrm{out}} = k_i^{\mathrm{in}} + c. </me>
<solution>
<p>
</p><p>
When we add vertex <m>i</m>, its out-degree is <m>c</m> and its in-degree is 0. Later on, 
if its total degree is <m>k_i</m>, then we still have  <m>k_i^{\mathrm{out}}=c</m>, and so
<m>k_i^{\mathrm{in}} = k_i - c,</m>.
</p>
</solution>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Now show that Preferential Attachment is just the undirected version of Price's Model with <m>a=c</m>.
<solution>
<p>
</p><p>
The probability that an edge from vertex <m>n+1</m> is incident with vertex <m>i</m> is
<me>\frac{k_i}{2cn} = \frac{c + k_i^{\mathrm{in}}}{2cn} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{k_i^{\mathrm{in}}}{cn}</me>
and this is Price's model with <m>a=c</m>.
